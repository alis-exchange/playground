# Playground
The playground repository houses various alis.exchange code examples from the playground organisation.

## Getting Started
Clone the repo and install the required dependencies to experience the elegance of gRPC services.

Global definitions are found in the .proto file. These definitions are language agnostic and are propagated throughout the services. Experience it first-hand by typing `client.`.
